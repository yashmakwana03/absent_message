## 🚀 Overview & My Journey

**Attendance Manager** is a project born out of necessity.

As the **Class Representative (CR)** at RK University for the past two years, I have been responsible for taking attendance and generating absent messages for parent groups. Initially, I solved this by building a simple website using inline CSS and JavaScript. While it worked, it had limitations: no offline storage and no easy way to save logs.

In my **5th semester**, I learned Flutter as part of my curriculum and saw the perfect opportunity to upgrade my workflow. I built this app to replace my old website, adding **SQLite for offline access**, faster entry methods, and automated message generation.

Now, when faculty ask for attendance reviews, I can instantly provide HTML files or text summaries directly from my phone. This project reflects my journey from basic web development to full-stack mobile engineering.

## ✨ Key Features

- **⚡ Quick Actions:** Mark attendance for a whole class in seconds.
- **📊 Dashboard:** Real-time view of daily stats and shortcuts.
- **🔍 Smart Search:** Instantly find student records by name or ID.
- **📂 Local Database:** Powered by **SQLite** for instant loading and 100% offline access – a major upgrade from my previous web tool.
- **🛡️ Data Safety:** Built-in **Backup & Restore** functionality (`.db` files).
- **🎓 Student Management:** Add, edit, or delete student profiles and organize them by department.
- **📈 Analytics:** View attendance percentages per student or per class.
- **💬 Message Generation:** Auto-generate formatted absent messages for WhatsApp groups.
- **📤 Export Options:** Generate HTML files for faculty to fill online registers or text summaries for daily reviews.

## 📂 Project Structure & File Guide

Here is a quick map of the codebase to help developers understand the purpose of each file:

### **Core**
- **`main.dart`**: The entry point. Sets up the app theme, routes, and initializes the root widget.
- **`database/database_helper.dart`**: The "brain" of the app. Handles all SQLite operations (CRUD), table creation, and complex queries for reports.

### **Screens (UI)**
- **`splash_screen.dart`**: The animated startup screen with the app logo.
- **`home_screen.dart`**: The main dashboard containing the "Take Attendance" button, daily summary widgets, and navigation grid.
- **`report_generator_v3.dart`**: The core screen for taking attendance. It allows CRs to toggle absentees and generate the final message.
- **`daily_report_screen.dart`**: Displays a visual summary of the day's attendance (Present vs Absent charts).
- **`search_screen.dart`**: A powerful analytics dashboard. Allows searching for students, sorting by "Defaulters" (low attendance), and viewing class performance.
- **`student_detail_screen.dart`**: Shows a 360° view of a specific student, including their overall percentage, subject-wise breakdown, and dates absent.
- **`custom_report_screen.dart`**: Allows users to select a date range and export detailed reports as HTML or Text.
- **`time_table_screen.dart`**: Manages the weekly class schedule and defines which subjects are Electives.
- **`manage_enrollment_screen.dart`**: Handles mapping students to specific elective subjects.
- **`student_input_screen.dart`**: Provides forms to add students manually or via a bulk text import feature.
- **`department_setup_screen.dart`**: A setup screen to configure department names (e.g., CE, IT) before adding students.
- **`backup_screen.dart`**: Interface for exporting the database file (`.db`) or restoring from a backup.
- **`about_me_screen.dart`**: A portfolio page displaying developer information and contact links.

### **Models**
- **`student.dart`**, **`department.dart`**: Data models representing the database entities.
- **`student_report_models.dart`**: Helper models used to calculate and pass analytics data between screens.
